# üí≥ Bank Management Web Application

## üìù Introduction

This project is a **full-stack banking web application** designed to simulate the core features of an online banking system. It allows users to manage bank accounts, request and track various types of loans, and perform secure transactions. The application is divided into:

- A **frontend** built using **Angular** and **Angular Material**.
- A **backend** developed in **ASP.NET Core (C#)** with **Entity Framework Core** for data access and SQL-backed migrations.

## üß∞ Technologies Used

### üîπ Frontend ‚Äì Angular

- **Angular 19**: Latest stable version offering modularity and robust component architecture.
- **Angular Material & CDK**: For responsive UI components, dialog boxes, snackbars, etc.
- **NgRx**: For reactive state management using `Store`, `Effects`, and `Devtools`.
- **RxJS**: For reactive programming and observable data streams.
- **CoreUI**: For modern admin dashboard styling and structure.
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed language that compiles to JavaScript.
- **Zone.js**: Angular's async context management.

#### Development Tools:
- `@angular/cli`: For managing Angular workspace and commands.
- `karma`, `jasmine`: For unit testing.

### üîπ Backend ‚Äì ASP.NET Core

- **.NET 8.0**: The application uses the latest .NET version for performance, support, and minimal APIs.
- **ASP.NET Core MVC**: To expose RESTful APIs.
- **Entity Framework Core**: For ORM-based database interactions with migration support.
- **JWT Authentication**: For secure, stateless user session management.
- **Controllers**: Include functionality for banking operations, transfers, and loans.
- **Services**: Handle business logic like payment processing, loan handling, etc.
- **Database Context (`BankDatabaseContext`)**: EF Core's DbContext managing models like `Bank`, `Loan`, `TransactionHistory`.

#### Core Backend Components:
- `Controllers/`: Handle routing and API endpoints.
- `Models/`: Define entities like `Loan`, `Bank`, and `TransactionHistory`.
- `Services/`: Contain core logic for loan processing, transfers, etc.
- `HttpReqObject/`: Contain DTOs for various requests like editing profile, transferring money.
- `Migrations/`: EF Core migrations to manage DB schema over time.

## üåø Branch Structure

This repository follows a clear separation of concerns through Git branches:

- **`frontend` branch**: Contains the Angular-based frontend code.
- **`backend` branch**: Contains the ASP.NET Core backend implementation.

Ensure you check out the correct branch depending on the part of the application you're working with.
